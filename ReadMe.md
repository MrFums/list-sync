## üîé How it Works

The IMDB to Overseerr Sync Tool utilizes a mix of Python and powerful libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and the [Overseer API](https://api-docs.overseerr.dev/#/) to find and request missing movies and TV shows.

Here‚Äôs a brief breakdown:

1. **Authentication:** Input your Overseerr URL and API key to securely access your movie and TV show library.
2. **IMDB List Fetching:** Fetch and parse movies and TV shows from your specified IMDB list ID.
3. **Configuration Management:** Tailor the tool to your preferences, and save these settings for future use.
4. **Processing:** The tool processes each movie and TV show, importing it into Overseerr, while handling any errors that come up.
5. **Status Updates:** Receive real-time updates on the status of each movie and TV show (e.g., already available, requested, not found).
6. **Encryption:** Securely encrypt your configuration data to ensure your credentials are protected.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

## Installation: Docker (Recommended)

To ensure the tool runs consistently across different environments, use Docker.

1. **Install Docker**:

    Ensure Docker is installed on your system. If it's not, follow the [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

2. **Create a working directory**:

    Make a folder to house the application's log files (e.g. imdb-to-overseerr)

3. **Pull and Run the Docker Image**:

    Use the following one-liner to pull and run the Docker image:

    ```sh
    sudo docker pull ghcr.io/woahai321/imdb-to-overseerr:main && sudo docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)/data:/usr/src/app/data" -e TERM=xterm-256color ghcr.io/woahai321/imdb-to-overseerr:main
    ```

4. **Use this command for subsequent runs**:

    Use the following command to run the Docker image:

    ```sh
    sudo docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)/data:/usr/src/app/data" -e TERM=xterm-256color ghcr.io/woahai321/imdb-to-overseerr:main
    ```

OR

## Standard Python Environment

If you prefer running the tool in a standard Python environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository and Navigate to the Directory**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/woahai321/imdb-to-overseerr.git
    cd imdb-to-overseerr
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

    Make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed, then install the required dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Script**:

    ```sh
    python add.py
    ```

OR

## Poetry

Poetry offers several advantages over traditional Python dependency management methods:

- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies the installation process with a single command and manages virtual environments automatically.
- **Version Control:** Tracks exact package versions, making it easier to reproduce environments and avoid version drift.
- **Security:** Integrates with security tools to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensures consistent behavior across different operating systems.

### Installation and Usage with Poetry

1. **Install Poetry**:

    ```sh
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```

2. **Clone the Repository and Navigate to the Directory**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/woahai321/imdb-to-overseerr.git
    cd imdb-to-overseerr
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

    Make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed, then install the required dependencies:

    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

4. **Run the Script**:

    ```sh
    poetry run python add.py
    ```

OR

1. Use [devcontainer](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) to bootstrap pre-built dev environment: [DevContainer documentation](https://containers.dev/)


### Configuration

1. **Run the Script and Fill in the Required Details When Prompted**:
    - **Overseerr URL**: Your Overseerr instance's base URL.
    - **API Key**: The API key from your Overseerr account.
    - **IMDB List ID**: The ID of the IMDB list you want to import.

2. **Saving Configuration**:
    - The script will prompt you to enter a password to encrypt your configuration.
    - This encrypted configuration will be saved and reused for future imports.

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid API Credentials**
   - **Solution:** Ensure your API key is correctly entered and matches Overseerr's credentials.

2. **Unexpected Script Behavior**
   - **Solution:** Check the `overseerr_sync.log` file for detailed error messages and resolve the issue based on these logs.

3. **Failed to Fetch IMDB List**
   - **Solution:** Ensure the IMDB list ID is correct and the list is publicly accessible.

4. **Decryption Error**
   - **Solution:** Ensure you enter the correct password for decrypting the configuration. If the password is lost, delete the `config.enc` file and reconfigure.
